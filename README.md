This repo contains the cumulative COVID-19 death cases in Malaysia, updated daily & the Python script to scrape the data.


# DATA FIELDS

Each row of data contains the following fields: 

Death Number, State, Gender, Age, Hospital, Comorbidity, Link


# DATA SOURCE

Data is in CSV format and updated daily at 20:00 (GMT +8). It is scraped from From the Desk of the Director-General of Health Malaysia https://kpkesihatan.com/


# USE CASE

Researchers, Data Scientist, Students, or anyone interested in understanding more about the COVID-19 death cases in Malaysia can use the data for deep-dive analysis.

The Python script to scrape the data is available. You can run it daily to integrate it with your data pipeline.

# DASHBOARD

I've made a simple dashboard to analyse the data. https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/9af48a31-ebb6-43e5-899b-f2fc70c26189

# CONTRIBUTING

Currently, the data is only available from Death Case #142 onwards because I couldn't find a tabular form that I can scrape easily. You can help by completing the data before case #142 or let me know if you find any resources for those death cases.
